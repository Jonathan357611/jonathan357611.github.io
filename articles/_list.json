It uses a 2.13\" Dual-Color E-Ink display from WaveShare (in black and red) and runs a Python script to fetch data from the German substitution plan provider, <a href=\"https://www.dsbmobile.de\">DSBMobile</a>, every 30 minutes. I'm using the <a href=\"https://github.com/nerrixde/DSBApi\">DSBApi</a> by nerrixde. You can find an installer in my repo to set it up easily on a fresh Raspberry Pi OS Lite install",
