<p>This is my most recent design of my "Binary Clock". Its the best way to tell the time quickly. Trust me.</p>
<p>It uses three rows, the top one for seconds, middle for minutes and the last one for hours with six columns each making 18 cells in total.
    The hours-row would not actually need six columns, but I had WS2812b's in abundance.
    You would then just read each row as binary, where a turned on light equals a 1 and a turned off one a 0.
    <br><br>
    If you dont know how to read binary:
    Each is double the column before it. It is read right to left. This means that the outer right cell would be 1, the one left to it 2, then 4, 8, 16 and finally 32.
    You then just add the value of turned on cell (a "1" in binary).

    With this knowledge, you'd be able to "translate" the clock into conventional time, although it will probably be outdated the time you read the clock. Note that this more like a "what if" or "I am bored" type of project instead of
    a "lets make something useful" type of project.

    So what is the time?
    <br>
    The time would be something around 22:39:47 (took that from a single frame of the GIF)

    I am currently working on integrating the clock with my HomeAssistant.
    This would make the clocks light adjust to my rooms lighting and make it not annoy you in your sleep.
    <br>
    <br>
    I also want to make it look "more clean" by adding animations, background lightning and especially a fading effect instead of just on and off.
