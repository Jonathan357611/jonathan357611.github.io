                        I am <span class="age underline"></span> years old, from <span class="underline">Germany</span> and have been programing for roughly <span class="programing_since underline"></span>% of my life.
                        <br><br>
                        I love learning about various topics to understand our world better, which has allowed me to explore many interesting things.
                        <br><br>
                        My passions are <span class="underline">programing,</span> <span class="underline">photography</span>, <span class="underline">3D-printing</span>, (astro)<span class="underline">physics</span>, <span class="underline">astronomy</span>, <span class="underline">reading</span> (mostly scifi).
                        I'm also very interested in <span class="underline">space</span> and <span class="underline">aviation</span> related topics. I always try to understand the newest developments in these industries.
                        <br><br>
                        As for "real-life-things", I enjoy lots of <span class="underline">cycling</span> and <span class="underline">rowing</span> in my freetime.
                        <br><br><br>
                        And this is my portfolio - a humble drop in the vast ocean that the World Wide Web is, just a few hundred words amidst trillions of sentences coexisting in this digital realm.
                        <br><br>
                        On this website I am trying to show my work and maybe even get some feedback.
                        <br><br>
                        Enjoy <span class="heart">&lt;3</span>

                    <p>I am good with <span class="underline">Fusion 360</span> which allows me to design my own <span class="underline">3D-prints</span>. I often utilize it to aide with my projects.
                    <br><br>
                    For my photography and astrophotography projects I often use <span class="underline">Adobe Lightroom</span>. For my cinemography projects I'm working with <span class="underline">Adobe Premiere Pro</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    I am currently learning gamedev, which required me to learn <span class="underline">Blender</span> to design my own game assets. For my games I use <span class="underline">Unity</span>.</p>

                        My most utilised language is currently <span class="underline">Python</span>. It was also the first language I learned at the age of 11 and I feel the saviest in it.
                        <br><br>
                        As you can hopefully tell by this portfolio, I am also able to create websites and webapps with <span class="underline">HTML/CSS/JS</span>.
                        <br><br>
                        For my gamedev related projects I most often need <span class="underline">C#</span> although I have started to learn a bit <span class="underline">Godot Script</span>.
                        <br><br>
                        As an avid linux user, I of course can create some basic <span class="underline">bash</span> programs.

                        Here's some other frameworks/skills I also wanted to include:
                        <br><br>
                        - <span class="underline">Flask</span>: I am skilled with Flask for Python and have used it for lots of projects.
                        <br><br>
                        - <span class="underline">Microcontrollers</span>: I am heavily invested in everything hardware. You might be able to tell this trough my hardware-heavy projects.
                        <br><br>
                        - <span class="underline">Raspberry Pis</span>: These tiny computers are also often used for my projects.
