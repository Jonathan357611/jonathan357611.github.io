                        Just a few hundred words amidst trillions of sentences coexisting in this digital realm.
                        <br>
                        Yet here you are, reading and interpreting these words, turning them into emotions, as if they held any meaning.
                        <br>
                        All this thanks to your brain, a biological supercomputer. It's the marvel of biology.
                        <br>
                        Perhaps my projects will even be able to trigger some neurons when taking a look at them. I hope so.
                        <br>
                        Isn't it amazing?

                    <p>Take some time and think about humanity. Such an unlikely thing to happen in our universe — so small, yet so beautiful. So incredibly complex.</p>
                    <p>Personally, I think it's truly amazing that I — a single, tiny human floating through this universe on a big rock — was able to showcase my projects, the things I'm proud of, online in my portfolio. For other humans to see. Enjoy <span class="highlight"><3</span> </p>

                        Maybe this biological marvel of the universe even finds some of my projects intriguing, granting them a bit more processing power to think about them.

                    <br><br>
                    For my photography and astrophotography projects I often use <span class="underline">Adobe Lightroom</span>. For my cinemography projects I'm working with <span class="underline">Adobe Premiere Pro</span>.

                    I am currently learning gamedev, which required me to learn <span class="underline">Blender</span> to design my own game assets. For my games I use <span class="underline">Unity</span>.</p>

                        My most utilised language is currently <span class="underline">Python</span>. It was also the first language I learned at the age of 11 and I feel the saviest in it.

                        As you can hopefully tell by this portfolio, I am also able to create websites and webapps with <span class="underline">HTML/CSS/JS</span>.
                        <br><br>
                        For my gamedev related projects I most often need <span class="underline">C#</span> although I have started to learn a bit <span class="underline">Godot Script</span>.
                        <br><br>
                        And lastly, as an avid linux user, I of course can create some basic <span class="underline">bash</span> programs. I often write some small install scripts with it.

                        My "main" language was always and still is Python. It was the first "real" language I started to learn at the age of 11. Most of my projects are written in it.
                        <br><br>
                        I'm also pretty mediocre in HTML/CSS and JS.

                        C# is what I'm actively learning for Unity gamedev.

                        C++ is another language I have to use frequently for programming microcontrollers.
                        <br><br>
                        Some more languages I'm able to program in are Bash, some basic Dart and Godot-Script.

                        - Selenium: I've also got some projects using selenium & python for some webscraping.
                        <br><br>
                        - Hardware: There are quite a few projects of mine which use microelectronics sometimes placed on custom designed PCBs.
